#### this script creates a secure passwords that are impossible to crack 
A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and easy to remember. Today it seems like the requirements for creating a strong password are becoming more and more demanding. But, thereâ€™s a reason for it.
## Strong Password Best Practices
1. Do not use sequential numbers or letters <br/>
For example, do not use 1234, qwerty, jklm, 6789, etc.
2. Do not include your birth year or birth month/day in your password <br/>
Remember that cyber criminals can easily find this information by snooping into your social media accounts.
3. Use a combination of at least eight letters, numbers, and symbols <br/>
 The longer your password and the more character variety it uses, the harder it is to guess. For example, nN/zDFxse9JIgL9JTR3r7i? uses a unique combination of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
 4. Combine different unrelated words in your password or passphrase
