A strong password is one that is difficult to guess and easy to remember. Today it seems like the requirements for creating a strong password are becoming more and more demanding. But, there’s a reason for it.
## Strong Password Best Practices
1. Do not use sequential numbers or letters <br/>
For example, do not use 1234, qwerty, jklm, 6789, etc.
2. Do not include your birth year or birth month/day in your password <br/>
Remember that cyber criminals can easily find this information by snooping into your social media accounts.
3. Use a combination of at least eight letters, numbers, and symbols <br/>
 The longer your password and the more character variety it uses, the harder it is to guess. For example, nN/zDFxse9JIgL9JTR3r7i? uses a unique combination of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
 4. Combine different unrelated words in your password or passphrase <br/>
 This makes it difficult for cyber criminals to guess at your password. Do not use phrases from popular songs, movies, or television shows. Use three or four longer words to create your passphrase. For example, 9SpidErscalKetobogGaN.
 5. Do not use names or words found in the dictionary <br/>
Substitute letters with numbers or symbols to make it difficult to guess the password. Or deliberately use spelling errors in the password or passphrase. For example, P8tty0G#5dn for “patio garden.”
6. Use a password manager to store your passwords <br/>
 Do not store your passwords in a document on your computer. Make sure you’re using the password manager tool provided to you by the IT/support team to store all professional and personal passwords.
